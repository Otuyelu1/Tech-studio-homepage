            <p class="">
              There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there is a

              who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers who can design creative
              solutions.

            <p>
              The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business
              globally, and is disrupting industries
              from education to manufacturing.

              language – JavaScript.
              You’ll have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have

              a team in a development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll
              have gained foundational skill in many
              disciplines that touch web development – managing complex data sets, securing your
              applications with encrypted
